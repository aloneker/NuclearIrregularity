# NuclearIrregularity

This repository will host the code used to calculate and analyze nuclear membrane irregularity for my thesis work. It will be cited in all relevant publications. 

Irregularity describes the normalized area of deviation from a perfect circle with the average radius of the nucleus. Additional measures of irregularity are also measured, including the normalized standard deviation of the radius, and the curvature of membrane indentations.
